# Mailserver Infrastructure

## Description

docker-mailserver AWS deployment
** You should change DKIM record manually **


** If you are using an Elastic IP address for your server, you can configure the reverse DNS record of your Elastic IP address by submitting a Request to Remove Email Sending Limitations (root account credentials required), and you don't need to use Amazon Route 53. **
